Breast Cancer Tumor Classification Using Machine Learning
This repository contains the implementation and evaluation of three machine learning algorithms‚ÄîNaive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)‚Äîto classify breast tumors as benign or malignant using features from the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset.

The models were developed in Octave, with custom implementations focusing on statistical robustness and performance. Data preprocessing included normalization and class-balanced splits for training and testing. Evaluation was based on standard classification metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

üîç Summary of Results

Neural Network (ANN): Highest accuracy at 98.83%, with strong F1-score performance.

SVM: Achieved 93.57% accuracy using a custom implementation of the maximum-margin classifier.

Naive Bayes: Delivered 89.55% accuracy, standing out for its simplicity and speed.
